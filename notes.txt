Why so slow?
We're maxing out at 30fps, but only at 10% CPU utilization.  Does simple2d do some sort of frame rate limiting?

the FPS cap is set at 60 in window.c


Suppose we want some pseudo-3D.
the lissajous will need a z-coordinate
line widths will be scaled by their distance from the POV.

we can perhaps implement some kind of coordinate transform for all of the points
